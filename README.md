# Flipping-Tile-Memory-Game

The game has a grid of 16 tiles with matching values in pairs. When the game starts, all tiles are turned face down. The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them.
If the two tiles have the same image, they remain face up. If not, they should be flipped face down again after a short delay. The game should be different every time the game is refereshed.
